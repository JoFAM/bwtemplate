# bwtemplate

This repository contains a few Rmarkdown templates for us at UGent faculty of Bioscience Engineering. To be easily installable, these templates are available in a public repository. 

The code in the repository is licensed using GPL v3, and the code for the templates can be used under that license.

**The UGent logo is copyright protected and can only be used if you have a direct link to Ghent University!**
